# BlockDrive (Decentralized Storage and sharing DAPP)

A safe and secure way to store and share data with other users over internet using blockchain technology.

# Problem 

In today's world, digital safety has become huge concerned matter for user. Noone want their data used by big company to train their AI models.

Everyone want safety over internet and control over their data which can provide by blockchain technology. Due to which, a massive adoption of blockcahin technology have been seen for last few years.

There is some problem faced to store data in Centralized way:

**Single Point of Failure** : Centralized systems rely on a single serve or data center to store all data, including images.​

**Security Risks**: Centralized systems are more vulnerable to security breaches as they are a prime target for hackers.​

**Lack of Transparency** : With Centralized storage it can be difficult to ensure that all users have access to the same version of an image, which can lead to version control and inconsistencies​

# Solution 

Blockchain technology has a ability to solve user concerned over safety.

To sove this issue:

I made a decentralised storage and sharing service to overcome users fear while storing and sharing data over internet. In this system, you can store your data on internet so that you can access your data at anytime through internet.​

In our project, user can storage their data and if they want to share file or images with friends or family, so they can share just by taking their wallet address.
